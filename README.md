# Databases project

Commands:

sudo yarn <---- adds all the libraries to the project
sudo yarn start <----- starts up the local server

Both these must be ran on both front end and backend to start both servers

You must have npm and yarn installed for it to be successful, we use yarn as our package manager.

I would also advise downloading pgadmin and linking it with our database so you dont have to go through a terminal with SQL.
